		- pip install docx
		- pip install docxtpl
	- Second way is to open the folder in which you downloaded the tool and type in the folder route "cmd", a command prompt will show type in: python libraries.py, this will install the libraries needed.

Once the libraries are ready and the tool is downloaded, put the CV file in the same folder of the tool, the CV must be in docx format example: CV.docx

Now you can use the tool, to use it type "cmd" in the folder route, a command prompt will show type in: python V1_destroy_ats.py

The tool will start and will ask you for the CV file name, enter the name for example: CV.docx (this is case sensitive)
Next it will ask you to enter the file with job description, this file should have only ten lines of job description. enter the file name for example: job_desc.txt
